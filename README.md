# Search Algorithms Visualizer

Welcome to the Search Algorithm Visualizer, a React Vite app designed to help you visualize and understand two popular search algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). The user interface is built using ShadeCN for styling and Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling. The project directory is organized with a 'src' folder containing 'components' and 'hooks' as subfolders.

## Features

- Visualize Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms.
- Understand algorithmic concepts through interactive visualization.
- Responsive and stylish UI powered by ShadeCN and Tailwind CSS.

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leulabay1/search-algorithms-visualizer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd search-algorithm-visualizer
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start the development server and run the app locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action.
